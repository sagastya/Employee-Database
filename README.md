## Employee Database
The purpose of this project is to import employee data from six CSV files into a SQL databse and answer questions about the data. In other words, perform:
  1. Data Modeling 
  2. Data Engineering
  3. Data Analysis

As part of data modeling, inspected the CSvs to sketch out an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables using QuickDBD tool for importing into postgreSQL database. 
For Data Engineering. used the information from the ERD to create table schema for each of the six CSV files specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys andd other constraints. 

#### Tools used in this Project:
  1. SQL 
       * PostgreSQL
  2. ER Diagram Tool
       * QuickDBD
